Default groups

Even if you do not define any groups in your inventory file, Ansible creates two default groups: `all` and `ungrouped`.

The `all` group contains every host.

The `ungrouped` group contains `all` hosts that donâ€™t have another group aside from all.

Every host will always belong to at least 2 groups (`all` and `ungrouped` or `all` and some other group).

For example, in the basic inventory above, the host `mail.example.com` belongs to the `all` group and the `ungrouped` group;
the host `two.example.com` belongs to the `all` group and the `dbservers` group.

Though `all` and `ungrouped` are always present, they can be implicit and not appear in group listings like `group_names`.
